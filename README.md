Project - P1: 

Shouldn't get any errors or weird bugs while running this project. Only got the warning below when creating a modulus function: 

warning: implicit declaration of function ‘Mod’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
             if(Mod(i, simul) == 0)

Run the folowing command for help on how to run the project: 

./oss -h
