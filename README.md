Project - P1: 

Shouldn't get any errors or weird bugs while running this project.

Learned the new concepts:

fork() - fork off children from parent to run as a process
exec() - send children to worker file to cycle through given iterations
wait() - parent waits for child to finish executing before sleeping

Run the folowing command for help on how to run the project: 

./oss -h

or to skip the read on ./oss -h, just run:

./oss -n num -s num -t num
