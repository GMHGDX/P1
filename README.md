Project - P1: 

Shouldn't get any errors or weird bugs while running this project. Only got the warning below when creating a modulus function: 

    warning: implicit declaration of function ‘Mod’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
             if(Mod(i, simul) == 0)

All values (proc, simul, and iter) default to "1" if there it is not declared on command line.

Run the folowing command for help on how to run the project: 

./oss -h
